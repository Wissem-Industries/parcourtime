All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.3] - 2026-10-08

### Fixed

- Analytics: events relayed to Plausible carry the visitor address in `X-Plausible-IP`; Cloudflare was replacing it with the server address.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-10-08

### Fixed

- Analytics: the first-party event path is `/_w` instead of `/_plausible`, which some content blockers list.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-10-02

### Changed

- Analytics events are sent through the site to the self-hosted Plausible instance (Plausible module 4).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-02

- Sharing image generated from the latest campaign (phase timeline, estimated dates flagged), replacing the Parcoursup banner. Open Graph and Twitter tags completed with absolute image URL, dimensions and alt text.
- `images:og` script; the sitemap announced in `robots.txt` is added.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-02

First release under the shared versioning of the wissem.pro projects.
